Build My App is a website that is designed to connect people with ideas for great web apps, with developers that have the skills to make those ideas a reality. Our app has a smooth interface that facilitates the networking and communication between project owners and developers. It is easier than ever using Build My App, to either find work as a free lance web developer or to have your app ideas come to life as a project owner.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features

- Project Owners can post a project idea to our website
- Developers can view and sort through a list of project proposals
- Project Owners can view all the plans submitted by developers and select the one that works for them

- Developers and Project Owners can colaborate through our email integration
- Developers and Project Owners can keep track of the project status through our tracking system

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

# APIs

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication API here

https://auth0.com

Fully integrated with multiple authentication services such as Github, Facebook, and Google. Users can login using a trusted 3rd party or create their own secure account.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Payment API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

üö´Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

üö´These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products
